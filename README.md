## ASSIGNMENT â€“ 1
Write a menu-driven program in C to perform the following operations in an integer array allocated memory dynamically. The list may grow or shrink compared to the initial allocation as and when required. Multiple operations may be performed on the existing list without recompiling/re-executing the program. The individual operations should be implemented using a single function.

### List of Operations -
1. **Create:** Create an integer array and allocate memory dynamically.
2. **Count:** Count the number of elements in the array.
3. **Indexed Element:** Retrieve and display an element at a specific index in the array.
4. **Insert:** Insert an element at a specified position in the array.
5. **Delete:** Delete an element from the array for a given value.
6. **Merge:** Merge two arrays into a single array.
7. **Split:** Split an array into two separate arrays.
8. **Sort:** Sort the elements in the array in ascending or descending order.
9. **Search:** Search for a specific element in the array and display its position.
