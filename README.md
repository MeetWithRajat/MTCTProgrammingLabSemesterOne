### ASSIGNMENT – 1
Given Date: **2023-08-21**

Write a menu-driven program in C to perform the following operations in an integer array allocated memory dynamically. The list may grow or shrink compared to the initial allocation as and when required. Multiple operations may be performed on the existing list without recompiling/re-executing the program. The individual operations should be implemented using a single function.

#### List of operations -
1. **Create:** Create an integer array and allocate memory dynamically.
2. **Count:** Count the number of elements in the array.
3. **Indexed Element:** Retrieve and display an element at a specific index in the array.
4. **Insert:** Insert an element at a specified position in the array.
5. **Delete:** Delete an element from the array for a given value.
6. **Merge:** Merge two arrays into a single array.
7. **Split:** Split an array into two separate arrays.
8. **Sort:** Sort the elements in the array in ascending or descending order.
9. **Search:** Search for a specific element in the array and display its position.

### ASSIGNMENT – 2
Given Date: **2023-08-28**

Write a menu-driven program in C, which perform the following on **single linked list** (Write a function for each of the operations).

#### List of operations -
1. Create a linked list.
2. Print the content of the list.
3. Insert a node after the kth node (k may be any integer).
4. Insert a node after the node (first from the start) containing a given value.
5. Insert a node before the kth node (k may be any integer).
6. Insert a node before the node (first from the start) containing a given value.
7. Delete the kth node (k may be any integer)
8. Delete the node (first from the start) containing a specified value.
9. Find if two list are equal (Boolean output).
10. Find the reverse of a list (not just printing in reverse).
11. Concatenate two lists.
12. Merge two lists, those are in ascending order (before and after merging).

### ASSIGNMENT – 3
Given Date: **2023-09-11**

Write 4 program in C to implement the following data structure and it's operations.

#### List of programs and operations -
1. Write a program to implement a stack data structure using an array.
2. Implement a system which can handle more than one stack (n stacks) using arrays.
3. Write a boolean function to return true if two stacks are equal.
4. Write a program for dynamic implementation (using link list) of stacks (n stacks).
5. Write a program to implement queue data structure using an array.
6. Implement a system which can handle more than one queue (n queues) using arrays.
7. A boolean function to return true if two queues are equal.
8. Write a program for dynamic implementation (using link list) of a queues (n queues).
9. Implement a priority queue using linked list (any type).
